name: context-compression
description: Proactively compresses long conversations, codebase state, and implementation progress into a compact continuation brief that preserves goals, decisions, constraints, touched files, validation status, blockers, and next steps. Automatically apply when context grows, many files or logs have been reviewed, token budget may tighten, or before task switching, handoff, or resume. Do not wait for the user to ask.

# Context Compression

## Goal
Create a short, loss-minimized working summary that lets the next turn or next agent continue immediately.

## Default behavior
- This skill is proactive, not opt-in.
- When any trigger below applies, compress state for yourself before continuing.
- Do not wait for the user to explicitly say "压缩上下文".
- Only show the compressed summary to the user when it helps alignment, handoff, recovery, or the user asked for a recap.
- Prefer silent/internal compression over repeating long restatements in normal replies.

## Auto-trigger conditions
- The conversation has many substantial turns.
- Repo exploration, logs, diffs, or terminal output are getting large.
- Multiple files, fixes, or decisions have accumulated.
- You are about to switch subtasks.
- You are about to pause, hand off, or resume later.
- The system indicates long context, many rounds, or token pressure.
- You are about to ask a new question after a long implementation or debugging phase.

## Preserve these first
1. User goal and current success criteria
2. Decisions already made and why
3. Constraints, assumptions, and non-goals
4. Files, functions, commands, and outputs that matter
5. Validation status: tests, lints, errors, blockers
6. The single best next step

## Remove or collapse
- Repeated explanations
- Low-signal logs and stack traces
- Recoverable boilerplate from code
- Dead-end explorations that taught nothing
- Background facts unrelated to the current task

## Workflow
1. Reconstruct the current state in one sentence.
2. Extract only durable facts.
3. Merge duplicates and resolve wording drift.
4. Keep exact literals only when brittle:
   - file paths
   - schema, table, and field names
   - CLI commands and flags
   - API routes
   - exact error messages
5. Rewrite into short bullets grouped by status and decisions.
6. End with open questions and the single best next step.

## Output modes

### Internal working brief
Use by default when no user-visible recap is required.

### User-visible compressed context
Use when a summary helps the user re-align quickly, when handing off, or when resuming after interruption.

Use this template unless the user asks for another format:

```markdown
## Compressed Context
- Goal:
- Current status:
- Decisions:
- Constraints / assumptions:
- Relevant files / areas:
- Validation / evidence:
- Open questions / risks:
- Next recommended step:
```

## Compression rules
- Prefer bullets over paragraphs.
- One fact per bullet.
- Default target: 120-300 words.
- If the task is complex, go up to 500 words.
- If token pressure is severe, produce a capsule of 6-10 bullets.
- Do not invent missing details.
- Mark uncertainty explicitly with `Needs verification`.
- Mention unresolved blockers before nice-to-have details.
- When code matters, include file paths in backticks.
- Keep enough detail that another agent can continue without rereading the full transcript.

## By content type

### Conversation
Keep: requested outcome, decisions, constraints, unresolved asks.
Drop: politeness, repeated clarifications, stale alternatives.

### Code changes
Keep: file path, purpose of change, notable implementation choice, follow-up needed.
Drop: line-by-line narration that can be recovered from the diff.

### Logs and errors
Keep: latest relevant failure, trigger condition, current hypothesis, whether reproduced.
Drop: long repeated traces after the root issue is captured.

### Plans
Keep: current phase, completed steps, pending tasks, dependency order.
Drop: superseded plans.

## Fast capsule format
When a very small summary is needed, output:

```markdown
## Context Capsule
- Goal: ...
- Done: ...
- Key decisions: ...
- Constraints: ...
- Blocker: ...
- Next step: ...
```

## Quality check
Before finishing, ask:
- Could a new agent continue from this without rereading the full history?
- Did I preserve every decision that would be expensive to rediscover?
- Did I remove details that are easy to recover from the codebase or tools?
